OS Project 6
Operating System Simulator - Memory Management

Version Control:
GitHub repo: https://github.com/STLnick/oss-memory-management


To run the program:
First run 'make' to build 'oss' and 'user_proc'

Run command example:
./oss

(NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- To specify the method for Memory Address Generation use the flag `m` with the program

EX:	./oss -m R

R = Random   - Will randomly generate a number from 0 to 32000
W = Weighted - Will randomly generate a number from 0 to 32000 with the lower numbers having more weight therefore more likely to occur

* If `-m` is not specified then 'Random' will be the method used

- Use -h to get a basic description of the program
